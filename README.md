# TicTacToe

The follow mix project contains a module `TicTacToe.Game` which was built as part of a [code jam for Philly Elixir](https://gist.github.com/zorn/129279df227ab984d09472f00160c932).

Things you can do:

* Run `mix test` to see validation of behavior.
* Run `mix docs` to generate HTML documentation.
* Run `mix credo --strict` to validate the correctness of the code.
* Run `mix dialyzer` to confirm the manual typespecs.
